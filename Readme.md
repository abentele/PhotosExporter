# PhotosSync - Short project description

Started project in April 2019.

Status of the project: project just started

Contributors: Adam Fletcher, Andreas Bentele

The project is based on code from the [PhotosExporter](https://github.com/abentele/PhotosExporter) project, which was initiated by Andreas Bentele.

This project aims to build a macOS status bar app to export or synchronize your photos from the Photos app to:
* the file system (based on the [PhotosExporter](https://github.com/abentele/PhotosExporter) project): incremental export and snapshot export of photos to folders in the file system
* Google cloud: photos are synchronized to Google Photos
